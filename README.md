For-Loops-to-Automatize-Predictive-Models
=========================================

Some examples on how to incorporate for loops in predictive models and analyse quickly large datasets

The following functions will build a prediction model for a large datasets using only the top 5 predictors.

This is an example presented by Roger Peng in his Develpoing Data Products Class, part of Data Science Specialization offered by Coursera. For more info go to "Building R Packages Demo" class.
